PodcastManager - Frontend 

This is the frontend of the podcast organizer app I built using Angular. It uses the Apollo Client GraphQL library to fetch and handle all the interactions with the backend and it is composed by a single module, single router and multiple components, in order to keep everything simple and easy to code (maybe I could upgrade the structure if the things should become more complex).

This is a screenshot of the app on a very early stage:

LAUNCH INSTRUCTIONS:
  1) install angular cli (of course!)
  2) npm install
  3) ng serve
  
The associated backend is PodcastManager---Server
